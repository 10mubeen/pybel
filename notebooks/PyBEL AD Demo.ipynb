It is proposed that APP, beta- and gamma-secretases are all\\ located on the lipid raft, and the meeting of them is an indispensable step for Abeta generation. Endocytosis\\ can lead to clustering of APP, beta- and gamma-secretases from separate smaller lipid rafts into a larger one.\\ On the other hand, for myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), phosphorylation by protein kinase\\ C (PKC) or interaction with Ca(2+) can lead to its release from membrane into cytoplasm. This process induces the\\ release of actins and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which are important factors for endocytosis.\\ Thus, the present review proposes that MARCKS may be implicated in Abeta generation, by modulating free PIP2\\ level and actin movement, causing endocytosis\"\n",

It activates PPARγ leading to increased glucose disposal rates [Jung et al., 2005] and is also neuroprotective against Aβ neurotoxicity [Inestrosa et al., 2005]. Neuroprotection may result through modulation of Wnt signaling since an increase in β-catenin and inhibition of GSK-3β is observed upon exposure to rosiglitazone [Inestrosa et al., 2005], although a different study has shown that activation of PPARγ by a potent ligand leads to β-catenin degradation [Liu and Farmer 2004]. Nonetheless, in support of the role for PPARγ activation in neuroprotection, PPARγ agonists have potent anti-inflammatory effects [Luna-Medina et al., 2005], inhibit microglial activation [Bernardo et al., 2005; Heneka et al., 2005] and have been shown to improve verbal memory in AD patients with T2DM, possibly in a mechanism dependent on PPARγ activation . A recent report demonstrates that overexpression of PPARγ in cultured cells leads to a dramatic decrease in the production of Aβ, by increasing the rate of APP degradation via ubiquitination [D'Abramo et al., 2005]. This study also showed that by decreasing Aβ secretion, PPARγ protects the cells against H2O2-mediated necrosis [D'Abramo et al., 2005].\", 'Pathway': 'Peroxosisome proliferator activated receptor pathway', 'MeSHDisease': 'Alzheimer Disease'}\n",

In  the  human   neuroblastoma cell  line  SHSY5Y as well  as  in  primary  cultured neurons chronic treatment with IGF-1   leads  to a switch  from TrkA  to  p75NTR expression as seen  in aging  brains  [128]. This  switch causes increased 13- secretase activity   indirectly by activation of  neuronal sphin\\xad gomyelinase which  is responsible for hydrolysis of sphin\\xad gomyelin and  the  active liberation of  the  second messenger ceramide (review in (129]). Ceramide is responsible for  the molecular stabilization of  BACE-1, the 13-secretase  which  is rate-limiting for  generation of  A[130]. This  process leads to accumulation of Ap,  connecting IGF-1 R signaling to neu\\xad rotrophin  action  (Fig. l).  \"}\n",

Elevated intracellular Ca2+ level presumably activates α-calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (αCaMKII) and other Ca2+-dependent enzymes, eventuating in stronger synaptic associations between neurons.

Significant elevations in leptin levels in both CSF and hippocampal tissue of AD patients, compared with age-matched control cases, indicate a physiological up-regulation of leptin in AD. However, the level of leptin receptor mRNA decreased in AD brain and the leptin receptor protein was localized to neurofibrillary tangles, suggesting a severe discontinuity in the leptin signaling pathway. Collectively, our results suggest that leptin resistance in the hippocampus may play a role in the characteristic changes associated with the disease. These findings are the first to demonstrate such dysregulated leptin-signaling circuitry and provide novel insights into the possible role of aberrant leptin signaling in AD.

      "{'Evidence': \"We have previously demonstrated that Leptin reduces extracellular amyloid beta (Abeta) protein both in vitro and in vivo, and intracellular tau phosphorylation in vitro. Further, we have shown that these effects are dependent on activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in vitro. Herein, we investigated downstream effectors of AMPK signaling directly linked to tau phosphorylation. One such target, of relevance to Alzheimer's disease (AD), may be GSK-3beta, which has been shown to be inactivated by Leptin. We therefore dissected the role of GSK-3beta in mediating Leptin's ability to reduce tau phosphorylation in neuronal cells. Our data suggest that Leptin regulates tau phosphorylation through a pathway involving both AMPK and GSK-3beta. This was based on the following: Leptin and the cell-permeable AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside (AICAR), reduced tau phosphorylation at AD-relevant sites similarly to the GSK-3beta inhibitor, lithium chloride (LiCl). Further, this reduction of tau phosphorylation was mimicked by the downregulation of GSK-3beta, achieved using siRNA technology and antagonized by the ectopic overexpression of GSK-3beta. \"}\n",

"""
Module that contains the command line app

Why does this file exist, and why not put this in __main__?
You might be tempted to import things from __main__ later, but that will cause
problems--the code will get executed twice:
 - When you run `python -m pybel` python will execute
   ``__main__.py`` as a script. That means there won't be any
   ``pybel.__main__`` in ``sys.modules``.
 - When you import __main__ it will get executed again (as a module) because
   there's no ``pybel.__main__`` in ``sys.modules``.
